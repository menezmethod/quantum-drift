## CODE STYLE

Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces).  Follow standard JavaScript naming conventions.  Comments should be clear and concise.

## FOLDER ORGANIZATION

The project follows a modular structure.  See the project structure for details.  This structure should be maintained.  A new folder structure for imported assets is recommended: `/src/assets/models/`, with subfolders for flora, rocks, and terrain.  A new folder structure for imported assets has been implemented: `/src/assets/models/`, with subfolders for flora, rocks, and terrain.  The project uses a modular folder structure.  The `/src/assets/models/` folder now contains subfolders for flora, rocks, and terrain.  The file `/src/assets/models/objects/SP_Ground01.glb` has been removed from the project.  A new `src/core/NetworkManager.js` file has been added to handle networking logic for multiplayer support.  The `/assets` directory now contains subdirectories for `models`, `sounds`, and `textures`.  The `/src/assets/models/ships` directory now contains `ALTSPACE1.glb` and `ALTSPACE2.glb`.  The project structure has been reorganized to improve maintainability and facilitate LLM collaboration, as detailed in `docs/2025-03-11_11-36-quantum-drift-codebase-improvement-checklist.md`. The new structure centralizes core game logic, entities, UI components, assets, and configurations into dedicated folders. The project structure now follows the recommendations in `docs/2025-03-11_11-36-quantum-drift-codebase-improvement-checklist.md`, centralizing core game logic, entities, UI, assets, and configurations into dedicated folders.  All core game mechanics (ship management, weapon systems) are now centralized into reusable modules under the `core/` directory. All asset loading is now delegated to `AssetLoader.js`.  The project structure has been updated to reflect the centralization of asset loading, as detailed in `docs/2025-03-11-52-centralizing-asset-loading-in-codebase.md`. The game is now multiplayer only.  All asset loading is now handled by `AssetLoader.js`, removing duplicate loading functions from `index.js`. A codebase review was conducted on 2025-03-11 at 3:57 PM before any modifications were made. A new `WeaponSystem.js` file has been added to the `src/entities/weapons` directory.  The file structure of the codebase is detailed in the following files: `src/flatten.py`, `docs/DEBUGGING_CHECKLIST.md`, `.gitignore`, `webpack.config.js`, `src/core/InfiniteMap.js`, `README.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, `src/core/Game.js`, `Dockerfile`.  A new modularization checklist has been added to `docs/2025-03-12_22-16-untitled.md` to guide the refactoring of `Game.js` into smaller, more manageable modules. A detailed method mapping document outlining the distribution of `Game.js` methods into other modules has also been added to `docs/2025-03-12_22-16-untitled.md`.  The modularization of `Game.js` is detailed in `docs/2025-03-12_22-16-checklist-for-modularizing-game-js.md` and `docs/2025-03-12_22-16-untitled.md`.

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS

- All sound effects should be in the `src/assets/sounds` folder.
-  New features should be implemented incrementally and thoroughly tested.
-  Use a consistent approach to collision detection and handling.  The collision detection system has been updated to use oriented bounding boxes for more accurate collision detection. A two-stage collision detection system has been implemented, first performing a quick sphere-based check for efficiency and then performing a more accurate bounding box check for close objects. The checkSphereBoxIntersection method has been added for precise collision detection between spheres and boxes.  The bouncing laser system has been significantly improved, including the addition of a `checkBoxIntersection` method for more accurate collision detection with boxes, and support for compound collision shapes.  The improved bouncing laser system is detailed in `2025-03-12_21-09-fixing-unresolved-variable-issue.md`.  The `updateBouncingLasers` method has been updated to include the necessary variable declarations (`bounced`, `tempRay`, `tempVector`, `closestDist`) and to handle different collision shapes (boxes and spheres) more accurately.  A new `rayBoxIntersection` method has been added to handle ray-box intersection more effectively. The collision detection now uses a two-stage approach: a quick sphere-based check followed by a more accurate bounding box check if necessary.  The `rayBoxIntersection` method handles rotated boxes and returns both the intersection point and normal vector.  Error handling has been improved to handle cases where `obstacle.boundingBox` is not a THREE.Box3 object.  The `updateBouncingLasers` method has been significantly improved to handle different collision shapes (boxes and spheres) more accurately, and includes proper variable declarations. A new `rayBoxIntersection` method has been added for accurate ray-box intersection handling. The collision detection now uses a two-stage approach: a quick sphere-based check followed by a more accurate bounding box check if necessary. The `rayBoxIntersection` method handles rotated boxes and returns both the intersection point and normal vector. Error handling has been improved to handle cases where `obstacle.boundingBox` is not a THREE.Box3 object. The bouncing laser system now uses a two-stage collision detection system: a quick sphere-based check followed by a more precise box check if available.  The `rayBoxIntersection` method accurately handles ray-box intersections, considering box rotation.  Error handling is improved to manage cases where `obstacle.boundingBox` is not a THREE.Box3 object.
- The in-game ESC menu should be consistent with the main menu.  The "Change Ship" functionality in both menus now uses the same `ShipSelectionUI` instance and includes fade-in/fade-out transitions for improved user experience. Event listeners for menu buttons are now added only once during menu creation to prevent stacking.  The in-game ESC menu's "Change Ship" functionality should mirror the main menu's functionality, including options for changing ship and name, while maintaining consistent styling.  The game should not pause when the ship selection menu is open; the menu should function as an overlay on the continuously running game.  The `ShipSelectionUI` should be properly re-initialized to avoid conflicts with event listeners and ensure responsiveness.  The `ShipSelectionUI` should be properly initialized and cleaned up to prevent errors related to removing nodes that are not children of the container.  The `ShipSelectionUI` should be properly re-initialized to prevent event listener conflicts and ensure that the selected ship is applied correctly.  A check should be added to ensure the node exists and is a child of its container before attempting removal using `removeChild`.  The `ShipSelectionUI` should be properly re-initialized to prevent issues where the selected ship is not applied.  A check should be added to ensure the node exists and is a child of its container before attempting removal.  Before removing a node using `removeChild`, ensure it exists and is a child of its parent container.  The game should remain running while menus are open; menus should function as overlays.  The game should not pause while menus are open; menus should function as overlays on a continuously running game.  The `ShipSelectionUI` should be properly re-initialized and cleaned up to prevent errors related to removing nodes that are not children of the container.  A check should be added to ensure the node exists and is a child of its container before attempting removal using `removeChild`.  The in-game ESC menu should function identically to the main menu's "Change Ship" functionality, reusing the existing `ShipSelectionUI` component and maintaining consistent styling, and the game should remain running during menu interactions.  The implementation of the infinite map will involve the strategic placement of existing assets to ensure game playability, with collision detection adjusted accordingly.  The infinite map implementation should prioritize efficient asset placement and collision detection algorithms.

The implementation of the improved collision system, which uses compound shapes for more accurate collision detection, is documented in `QUANTUM_DRIFT_CHECKLIST.md`. For multiplayer, considerations for TCP/UDP architecture are needed. Simplest architecture for beginners will be researched.  Multiplayer support will be implemented using a client-server architecture with WebSockets. A dedicated `NetworkManager` class will handle all networking-related tasks.  This approach minimizes disruption to the existing codebase.  The game now uses a client-server architecture with WebSockets for multiplayer functionality, managed by a dedicated `NetworkManager` class.  This is detailed in `docs/2025-03-11_11-36-quantum-drift-codebase-improvement-checklist.md`.  Ensure the `shipType` sent from the server matches the keys in `AssetLoader` (e.g., 'FIGHTER', 'INTERCEPTOR', 'SCOUT', 'EXPERIMENTAL'). Add console logs to track if `player_update` events are received and if the positions are updating as expected in `updateOtherPlayers()`. Ensure your `NetworkManager` is receiving `laser_shot` events and that `fireLaser()` or `fireBouncingLaser()` are correctly adding these to the scene. Add console logs to confirm these events are triggered and check if the laser objects are visible with proper materials. Modify your 3D models in a tool like Blender to have separate materials for parts like the body and accents. Then, in `getShipModel()` in `assetloader.js`, set only specific materials to the team color while keeping others (e.g., windows) with original colors. Check the `MiniMap` class implementation to ensure it's being updated in the game loop with current positions. Verify the mini-map's camera is set up to view from above and that its canvas is visible on screen. Debug by adding logs to see if positions are being passed correctly. To improve visuals, give ships random, nuanced colors by modifying models to support partial coloring.  This means modifying 3D models to have separate materials for different parts (e.g., body, accents) and then, in `getShipModel()`, setting only specific materials to team colors while leaving others with their original colors.
