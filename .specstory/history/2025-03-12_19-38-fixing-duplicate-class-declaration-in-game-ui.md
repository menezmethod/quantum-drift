I'll help you fix the double GameUI declaration in the file. The issue is that there are two GameUI class declarations in the same file, which is causing conflicts. Let me examine the file structure first.

Looking at the file, I can see that there's a proper GameUI class declaration at the top, and then another one that extends AssetLoader and contains additional methods that should be part of the first class.

Let me fix this by merging these two declarations into a single, cohesive GameUI class.
